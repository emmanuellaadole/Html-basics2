        <h1>Understanding Meal Planning</h1>
            <p>To the uninitiated, meal planning can feel like an elusive practice or an overwhelming task, but
                that’s usually because we think about meal planning from the endpoint </p><p>— when all the recipes
                have been selected, when all the groceries have been shopped for, and a week of dinners was
                successfully made.</p><p> Put all the information in front of a newbie and their eyes grow wide with one
                resounding question: But how do I do it?</p>

               <h2>What it is:</h2> <dd>Meal planning is asking the <b>what's for dinner question</b> once for the whole week,
                instead of every night, and then shopping for and prepping the ingredients before cooking. </dd>
                <p>We believe the simplest way to approach meal planning is with three steps.</p>
                <ol><li>Select your dinners and their recipes, if needed.</li>
                <li>Shop for ingredients.</li>
                <li>Prepare those ingredients. </li> </ol>

            <dt>“Every meal should end with something sweet. Maybe it’s jelly on toast at breakfast or a small
            piece of chocolate at dinner – but it always helps my brain bring a close to the meal.”</dt><dd>~ Robert
